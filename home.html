                    Hey, My name is Zhiqin Lei. 
                    I am a senior majoring in Computer Science in UCSB.
                    I used to be a newbie designer, then I took the CS185-HCI class. 
                    I am interested in machine learning, web development and action role-playing video game. 
                    I am actively exploring those fields and now I decide to build a website to show my enthusiasim in Computer Science and my favorite games - The Elder Scrolls.
