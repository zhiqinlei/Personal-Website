                    My name is Zhiqin Lei. 
                    I am a senior majoring in Computer Science in UCSB, set to graduate in July 2020. 
                    I've complete an engineer internship at ABB Engineering Ltd. 
                    I am interested in machine learning, embedded system, and web development. 
                    I am actively exploring those fields of Computer Science and have built up many related and useful skills.
